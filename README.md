# LinkedListBankAccounts

This is a simple implementation of a bank system,

In which we store account details like (Name        PIN      ACC#    Amount),
Inside a Txt file, and we read the details into a Linked List Data Structure,

And we can perform operation through the data inside linked list, like:
Reading details of a particular account or all accounts, withdrawing or depositing amount etc.
